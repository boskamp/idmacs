IDMacs: GNU Emacs customized for SAP NetWeaver(R) Identity Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------


What is IDMacs?
---------------
IDMacs is a customized version of GNU Emacs for Windows, designed
for use as an external JavaScript editor in SAP NetWeaver(R) Identity
Management 7.2. The rest of this document assumes that you have
SAP NetWeaver(R) Identity Management 7.2, specifically the Identity Center
Management Console, installed on a machine. This machine will be referred
to as "IC Designtime".


Installation
------------
* If you have an existing Emacs installation on the IC Designtime,
carefully read the section 'Important Note for Existing Emacs
Installations' before proceeding.

* Download a precompiled GNU Emacs, version 24.x, for Windows from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ The currently recommended download for use with IDMacs is emacs-24.1-bin-i386.zip.

* Extract emacs-24.1-bin-i386.zip to the hard drive of the IC Designtime. The recommended directory is C:\, resulting in a subdirectory C:\emacs-24.1 as Emacs installation directory.

* If you have GIT installed, open a Windows command prompt and enter:

$ git clone https://github.com/boskamp/idmacs.git
$ cd idmacs

* If don't have GIT, download IDMacs as a ZIP file from https://github.com/boskamp/idmacs. Use the "ZIP" button in the upper left part of the page. Unzip that to the hard drive of the IC designtime. Open a Windows command prompt, and CD into the directory idmacs-master extracted from the ZIP.

* On the command line, enter:
$ idmacs-install

* When prompted, enter your Emacs installation directory (e.g. C:\emacs-24.1), then press Enter. Press the TAB key one or more times to automatically complete and cycle through directory names you have partially typed in.

* When prompted, confirm that it's OK to overwrite files in your Emacs installation directory by entering the letter y or Y, then press Enter.

* The installer should finish by displaying a message about successful installation on the command line.

* Start the SAP NetWeaver(R) Identity Management Identity Center Management Console (aka MMC). You will need to import and run a job to extract some metadata required for auto-completion.

* Navigate to the "Job folder" underneath the Identity Center configuration.

* It is recommended (but not required), that you create a dedicated folder for IDMacs-related jobs. For example, create a new folder "IDMacs" directly underneath "Job folder".

* Right mouse-click on this folder, and select "Import..." from the context menu.

* In the "Import to Identity Center" file selection dialog, navigate to the subdirectory "etc\idmacs\job" underneath your Emacs installation directory. if you followed the recommendations, this will be "C:\emacs-24.1\etc\idmacs\job".

* Select the file idmacs_job_export_sap_idm_symbols.mcc, and press OK.

* Press the "Next", button, then "Import".

* TODO: run job

* TODO: set as external script editor

Important Note for Existing Emacs Installations
-----------------------------------------------
IDMacs is designed as an overlay for an existing GNU Emacs installation
on Windows. It may OVERWRITE files of this Emacs installation and
thereby result in LOSS of existing customizations and modifications
you may already have applied to Emacs on your own. If you have an
existing Emacs installation on the IC Designtime, I therefore strongly
recommend that you install an additional Emacs instance,
dedicated for use with IDMacs.
